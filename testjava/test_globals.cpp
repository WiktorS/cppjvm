		on the behaviour of the GC so it's unpredictable, making
		bugs hard to catch. To see it here you might also need to
		increase the number of loops to 100000 or more.

		The rule is: if a reference needs to survive outside of 
		a local_frame, it must be wrapped with global<T>.

        It should be noted that you cannot avoid this problem by
        the clever idea of simply never declaring any local_frame 
        objects. Without them, local references never die and so
        the objects referred to are never collected.
